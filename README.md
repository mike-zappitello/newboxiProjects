nbaInfoStats
============

collaborative project to create interesting inforgraphs for nba stats

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
===========================================================
a few ideas for projects that we can try to work out:

--stats for who pulls defenses away and creates open shot for players
-->look for pass, pass, shoot and what that shooting percentage is
-->go by player, team, unit?

--most played units on playoff teams
-->look at substitutions and get stats on what units are on the floor the most for any team
-->find the top two units for each of the 16 playoff teams and work on their stats
-->get this as an infographic in time for the first round of the playoffs?

--shooting percentages
-->get each teams shooting percentage and defensive shooting percentage
-->compare how teams shoot when playing agains good defenses
-->who steps up agains good d's, who gets shut down by bad ones, who tourches bad ones?
-->could be an interesting graph of where teams get their buckets

--buckets graph
-->track how many points someone has per season versus minutes played
-->get a steadily increasing graph showing how players scored and who scored the most
-->could be a sweet fucking gif

--twitter project
-->get all nba players twitter handles
-->see who they are following and who they are following in common
-->look at how many followers <i>those</i> people have in common
-->order them from least followers to most and find some interesting people
-->a lot of interesting data do be groomed from twitter.  this is just idea 1

other housekeeping thoughts
-i'm goign to do a directory for each project
-each folder will have a folder for the code, a folder for data, and a folder for images?
-you can update images in git as well
