USAU College Nationals Project
------------------------------

i think that this would be a great project to have published by the time that college nationals rolls around. this gives us a lot of time to prepare and make sure that its working at its full potential. additionally, if we do a good job, we toss it up on reddit and rsd nospam and see where it goes from there. maybe some people will take note.

<b>project summary</b>
we want to create an info graph that allows users to compare the teams that make it to college nationals. it will give us a good practice round on how we go about creating these, and its something close to both of our hearts.  

<b>stats to consider</b>
* player rosters (names, hometowns, heights, etc)
* average distance from home to campus
* lists of tournaments played in, and distances traveled to get to them
* scores against opponents considered elite, we can use these for comparisons
* what else can you think of?

<b>programming skills to work on</b>
* scraping internet for scores
* using mapping features to calculate distances
* javascript to allow users to interact with info graphic
* javascript bunded with illustrator to draw out graphics as users toggle teams, players, tournys, etc
* css to change formats depending on selected teams
* html to display what our graphic and give it some context

<b>tasks to achieve goal</b>
* collect info on top 30 teams, ensuring we have all teams that make nationals
* collect data on tournaments and results for all teams being studied
* work out what statistics we want and how to impliment them
* discuss how we want to display the data
* get mock ups for each view we want in our infograph
* work on color templates and formatting for each team
* set up squarespace or wordpress to display final product

<b>sources for data</b>
* score reporter
* team websites
* team twitter acounts?
* tournament sites?
* ultimate media sites?
